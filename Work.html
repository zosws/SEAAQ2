    <h3>Luzon Cleanups</h3>
      <section id="cavite">
        <h3>Cavite</h3>
        <p>In Cavite City, our organization focused on reducing the heavy plastic pollution that accumulates along Manila Bay. Weekly coastal cleanups brought together local volunteers, students, and fisherfolk to remove debris that often endangered sea turtles, seabirds, and smaller marine animals. Beyond cleanup work, we restored damaged mangrove forests by planting new seedlings and training community stewards to care for them. These mangroves now serve as breeding grounds for fish and natural shields against erosion, helping revive the local coastal ecosystem. </p>
        <p>We also held workshops introducing sustainable fishing methods, emphasizing the importance of protecting juvenile fish and reducing accidental catch. Through these efforts, Cavite saw a noticeable improvement in water quality and a gradual return of marine life in areas where it had previously declined.</p>

      <section id="baguio">
        <h3>Baguio</h3>
        <p>Though Baguio City lies far from the ocean, its role in marine conservation is significant due to its influence on upstream waterways that eventually lead to coastal areas. We organized cleanups along creeks, parks, and canals to reduce waste that would otherwise travel downstream and harm marine ecosystems. A major part of our work involved educational programs in schools, where students learned how mountain waste impacts coral reefs and marine animals many miles away.</p>
        <p>By improving waste management practices and raising environmental awareness, Baguio became an upstream protector of marine life. The city now sends far less plastic pollution into river systems, indirectly safeguarding coastal habitats and the sea creatures that rely on them.</p>

      <h3>Visayas Cleanups</h3>
      <section id="iloilo">
        <h3>Iloilo</h3>
        <p>In Iloilo City, our organization focused on restoring the health of its mangrove belts and coastal ecosystems, which had been heavily affected by monsoon-borne debris. We led cleanup operations along Villa Beach and the mangrove areas near Oton, working with local fisherfolk and volunteers to remove plastic nets, discarded fishing gear, and waste that often trapped juvenile fish, crabs, and small marine creatures. Alongside the cleanups, we rehabilitated mangrove roots and helped plant new seedlings to strengthen breeding habitats and protect the shoreline from erosion. </p>
        <p>We also collaborated with community groups to introduce training on mangrove care and responsible coastal practices. Through these efforts, Iloilo saw improved water conditions and a gradual revival of small marine species that depend on healthy mangrove systems for survival.</p>
      </section>    

      <section id="cebu">
        <h3>Cebu</h3>
        <p>In Cebu City, our efforts centered on protecting the marine corridor near the Mactan Channel, a hotspot for both biodiversity and pollution from busy shipping routes. We organized a series of coastal and near-shore cleanup missions around the Cordova area, where floating plastic debris frequently drifted toward turtle feeding grounds and coral patches. With the help of divers and volunteers, we retrieved submerged waste, rescued entangled sea turtles, and prevented debris from settling onto sensitive coral zones.</p>
        <p>Beyond cleanup operations, we held awareness sessions for local boat operators and fishing communities, highlighting how proper waste disposal and net management reduce harm to turtles and coral ecosystems. Thanks to these combined efforts, the waters around Mactan saw fewer entanglement incidents and improved conditions for marine life.</p>

      <h3>Mindanao Cleanups</h3>
      <section id="davao">
        <h3>Davao</h3>
        <p>In Davao City, our team stepped in after a major storm swept tons of debris onto the shores of Matina Aplaya and Talomo District. We coordinated large-scale cleanups with barangay units, youth volunteers, and coastal residents to remove layers of driftwood, plastics, and urban waste that threatened shoreline species. During the cleanup, we rescued several storm-stranded animals—including juvenile rays, small octopuses, and a young dugong caught in discarded ropes—ensuring they received proper care before being returned to safe waters.</p>
        <p>To support long-term resilience, we also engaged local communities in disaster-preparedness training focused on marine protection, teaching how storm waste affects coastal ecosystems. Our efforts helped restore the cleanliness of Davao’s coastline and strengthened public awareness of the city’s marine biodiversity.</p>
      </section>    

      <section id="butuan">
        <h3>Butuan</h3>
        <p>In Butuan City, our work centered on the Agusan River Delta, a vital upstream system that ultimately feeds into Butuan Bay’s coastal habitats. We organized riverbank cleanups to intercept plastic waste, agricultural debris, and abandoned fishing materials that seasonal floods carried downstream. By removing this pollution early, we prevented it from reaching marine environments where it could threaten fish, turtles, and other coastal wildlife.</p>
        <p>Education was a key part of our mission. We worked with schools and riverside communities to promote better waste management and explain how inland actions affect marine ecosystems. As a result, Butuan became a stronger upstream guardian of marine life, sending significantly less pollution toward coastal waters.</p>
